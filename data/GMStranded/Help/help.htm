  <h1>Getting Started </h1>
  <p>Welcome to Gmod Stranded.<br>
    <br>
    This is the best gamemode Gmod has, hence the reason you joined this server.<br>
    You might have never played GMStranded before so that is why you are looking at this menu right now.<br>
    This gamemode is all about surviving, now this is not Discovery Channel, so no Bear Grylls nor Les Stroud. This is about you and your fellow stranded players.    <br>
    <br>
  To start out you need to get the main life necessities, then I mean water, food and shelter.<br>
  In order to get water you need to go to a lake or the sea and press E whilst being inside the water.<br>
  Now press E on the ground to look for seeds to plant so you can eat the fruit from those plants. (It takes a while before the plant has grown)<br>
  Now, for the shelter part, find a tree, use you hands to break the wood from the tree so you can spawn wooden props to sleep under.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Needs</h2>


<p>You need food, water and sleep to survive. You can track all three stats, as well as your health,<br />
by looking at the HUD box in the top left corner.</p>

<span style = "color: rgb(170,0,0);"><p>Health</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(0,170,0);"><p>Food</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(0,0,1700);"><p>Water</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(170,0,140);"><p>Sleep</p></span>

<p>If you lack any stat below zero, you will lose health,
and eventually die. To get food, simply press use on anything edible. It will instantly increase<br />
your food gauge, and also a little health. To get water you can either press use on something drinkable,<br />
or simply stand in the water anywhere on the map. To sleep, you can use the chat command <br />
<b><i>!sleep</i></b>, which will put you to sleep. You can then use  <b><i>!wakeup</i></b> while sleeping to wake up.<br />
Watch out though, while sleeping you quickly get thirsty and hungry, so be careful not to starve in your sleep.<br />
In addition - you need to sleep in safe shelter, or else you'll lose a lot of health while sleeping.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>


<p>You will gain skills by performing their respected actions. For example, by chopping wood you gain lumbering skill.<br />
Skills are useful for reducing process times and unlocking features. For example, at survival level 3, you can sprint.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Resources are gained through performing various actions. For example, you can get wood by chopping a tree.<br />
Resources can be used for various things such as spawning props.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>


<p>Tools are gained by making them at a workbench. Tools are useful for bettering your processes.<br />
For example, you can gain much more wood if you cut with a hatchet rather than your hands.<br />
Some actions can only be used with a tool, such as fishing with the fishing rod.</p>

<h2>How to get started</h2>


<p>To start out, you find some water. You can bottle the water for later by pressing use on the water.<br />
Secondly, you should secure some food. By foraging the ground (Press USE on the ground), you can gain seeds, which can<br />
be planted to grow into various plants. For example the melon seed grows a melon bush, with watermelons on it.<br />
Once you have food and water, you should get some wood or stone, and start building some shelter. When sleeping,<br />
you should be under shelter, if not you'll lose health. To gain wood, use your hands or a hatchet at a tree.<br />
To gain stone and/or iron, use your hands or a pickaxe at some rocks. Once all this is done, you can start choosing your own path!</p>
